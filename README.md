# spring-security-basics
The project demonstrates the very basics of securing of a REST API using Spring Security.

Instead of the default out of the box login page which Spring Security provides, this project implements a custom login page.

The custom login page is implemented using simple `HTML5`.

The project uses `@Controller` instead of `@RestContoller`.
