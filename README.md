# spring-security-basics
The project demonstrates the very basics of securing of a REST API using Spring Security.

Instead of the default out of the box login page which Spring Security provides, this project implements a custom login page.

The custom login page is implemented using `Thymeleaf` template engine. Checkout the `using-controller` branch for example of custom login page using plain `HTML5`.

The project partially follows the [Getting Started Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/) of securing a Spring Web Application.
